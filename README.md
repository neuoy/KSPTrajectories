Trajectories
============

A Kerbal Space Program mod to display trajectory predictions, accounting for atmospheric drag, lift, etc.

This mod will display a new trajectory on the map, which should match the KSP regular trajectory, excepted if your spacecraft encounters an atmosphere. Drag and lift are predicted and the resulting modified trajectory is displayed. It is compatible with the aerodynamic model of the original game, but also with Ferram Aerospace Research (automatic selection at game startup).

This mod is designed to help with aerobraking manoeuvers (trajectory after aerobrake is displayed), and to help reach a precise point on the ground (for example to land exactly at the Kerbal Space Center).

It is possible to configure a descent profile for space planes, so that you can tweak how you intend to fly at different altitudes. When you actually follow the trajectory, indicators will be displayed on the nav ball to show how the descent profile is configured for your current altitude, and also how you should correct your descent angle to reach your target ground impact.

The mod can also help reaching a precise location on any celestial body. Even when there is no atmosphere, the original game does not display where you'll arrive according to the body rotation. This mod adds a small cross on the body showing you're estimated impact location.

Features
--------

- Display atmospheric trajectories
