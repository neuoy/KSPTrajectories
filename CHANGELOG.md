## v1.7.0 for KSP 1.3.0
 - 2017-07-08

### Changes since the last release

 * Improved precision by accounting for reynolds number in drag. Fixes Issue #84.
 * Fix crash when turning on In-Flight trajectory display while in Map view. Fixes Issue #102. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!
 * Prevent click-through in certain situations. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!
 * Numbers in the user interface don't change as quickly anymore, allowing for better readability
 * Deviation readout now switches from E to W and from N to S instead of just showing negative numbers

### For Developers

 * Added a bridge to the newly created [Telemetry](https://github.com/fat-lobyte/KSPTelemetry) module,
   allowing for nice [graphs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/173609/27686194-febdbca6-5cd1-11e7-877d-1ab6e5069fb6.png)
   and better debugging of prediction precision.

- 2017-06-13

### Changes since the last release
  * Fixed in-flight targeting cross remaining in scence even after trajectory display was disabled.
  * Added toggle for in-flight trajectory display. Fixes Issue #96.

### Known Issues
  * Trajectory prediction is still fundamentally incorrect. See Issue #84.

## v1.6.7 for KSP 1.3.0

- 2017-06-09

### Changes since the last release
  * This release is brought to you by fat-lobyte (aka Kobymaru on the Forums)
  * Update ToolbarWrapper for blizzy78's Toolbar. Fixes Issue #78.
  * Enable Trajectories window in flight scence.
  * Implement in-flight trajectory line display. Please test and give feedback!
  * Fix Parenthesis silliness in .version file to make it valid JSON again. Thanks, ggpeters!

  * Disable Click-through. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!

### Known Issues
  * Trajectory prediction is still fundamentally incorrect. See Issue #84.
  * In-Flight trajectory for non-atmospheric trajectories is jerky and jumpy.
  * In-Flight trajectory leaves targeting cross in the scene, even when disabled.

### For Developers
  * KSP directory path is not hardcoded anymore. You can set up an environment variable in your Operating System named KSPDIR that points to the KSP installation directory.
  * Revamped build scripts for Visual Studio. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!
  * Added simple profiler class. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!
